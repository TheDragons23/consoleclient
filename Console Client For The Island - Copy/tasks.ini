For everyone with the problem that the check script doesnt work automatically. thats because some of the code doesnt work. its saying /script check in the mc chat not in the console. 

make a tekst document and save it as tasks.ini in there you need to paste this tekst: 
# Minecraft Console Client
# ScriptScheduler Tasks
# Example config file

# Structure of a task: [Task] Followed by triggers and other settings.
# The example below contains all the possible fields for a task
# Time is HH:mm format, several different hours can be provided

[Task]
triggerOnFirstLogin=true
triggerOnLogin=true
triggerOnTime=false
triggerOnInterval=true
timeValue=19:30
timeValue=08:10
timeInterval=0
script=script.txt

# Another minimal example: some properties may be omitted
# This is highly recommended for improving task readability

[Task]
triggerOnFirstLogin=false
script=script.txt

# Of course, the tasks file can contain as much tasks as you want.
# Another example tiggered on logging in and every night at midnight:

[Task]
triggerOnLogin=true
triggerOnTime=false
timeValue=00:00
script=script.txt

# Example of task occuring every 30 seconds
# Could be used for making a custom antiAFK procedure

[Task]
triggerOnInterval=true
timeInterval=5
script=reconnect.txt

[Task]
triggerOnFirstLogin=true
triggerOnLogin=true
triggerOnInterval=true
timeInterval=5
script=check.txt
